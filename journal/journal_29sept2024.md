# Learner Log Entry #2

### Rose:
I really enjoyed learning more about the command line. I personally hate working with it because I've never truly taken to the time to understand it, so this lesson was helpful.

### Bud: 
One thing I am looking into digging more into is the different things we can do with the command line. I know we've just scratched the surface with this past lesson. 

### Thorn: 
One challenging topic from this week's FOSS session is using the command line. Just like a programming language, it takes a little bit to get use the syntax and understand everything that be done. I think the same will hold for working with the terminal. Just have to force myself to practice it whenever I get the change instead of trying to avoid it like I have been.
