# Learner Log Entry #2

### Rose:
I enjoyed the discussion of the data management life cycle. This is something that I've come across before, but never really gave it the attention it deserves. I think it's a really good way of describing the process by which researchers use data. 

### Bud: 
One thing I am looking into digging more into are the CARE principles. I've never even heard of them before. I spend a lot of my working with data so I should become much more well-versed in these foundational data topic.

### Thorn: 
One challenging topic from this week's FOSS session is understanding when to apply a license. I've written code for a bunch of projects, but have never applied a license to them. After this week's session, I'm beginning to think I should go back through some of my important works on GitHub and apply a MIT license to them. This will become especially important when I start submitting my research to journals later this fall.
