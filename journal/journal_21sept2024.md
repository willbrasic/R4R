# Learner Log Entry #3

### Rose:
I enjoyed the discussion of building websites. I built my own website using GitHub this past summer and found it rather difficult to do so (despite the help of ChatGPT). This session would've been very helpful when I was building my own. 

### Bud: 
One thing I am looking into digging more into is building a website using GitHub. I used Hugo to build my website and did not find it easy at all. I'd like to look around online and discover easier ways to build a website that are just as attractive. Perhaps I'll build my website using an alternative to Hugo. 

### Thorn: 
The documents that generate the website are quite confusing. I found when building my website and rendering it offline before I published it that very minor syntax errors would be hard to trace and fix while blowing up the entire website. This is definitely something I could work on learning more about and improving on.
